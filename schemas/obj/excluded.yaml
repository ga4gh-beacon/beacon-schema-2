  description: (from Phenopackets v.2) Flag to indicate whether the disease was observed
    or not. Default is ‘false’, in other words the disease was observed. Therefore
    it is only required in cases to indicate that the disease was looked for, but
    found to be absent. More formally, this modifier indicates the logical negation
    of the OntologyClass used in the 'featureType' field. CAUTION It is imperative
    to check this field for correct interpretation of the disease!
