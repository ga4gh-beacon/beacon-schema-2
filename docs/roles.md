# Informations for Different Types of Beacon Users

The Beacon documentation provides information for different types of stakeholders,
depending on their interests and use cases. Although those will overlap, we highlight
information relevant for some general scenarios throughout the documentation.

## User

A Beacon **user** is interested in querying Beacon instances and networks, either through
web interfaces by using the Beacon API. While users of Beacon web forms in principle
do not need to understand the underlying query syntax and response formats they too may
benefit from some insights into the general capabilities of the underlying protocol.
