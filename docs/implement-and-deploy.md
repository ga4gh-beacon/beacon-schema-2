# Implement and Deploy a Beacon

Owners and managers of genomic data resources may (should!) be interested in "beaconizing"
their resources through the implementation of a Beacon API[1] for web-protocol based
access to their data.

Beacon software can be developed _de novo_, make use of code from existing solutions
or can directly be derived from the [Beacon reference implementation](https://b2ri-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) provided by the
beacon development team.
